                          #TODO List in Python

TO DO List is a simple API project created with everything that I learned on course Do Zero ao Deploy by Cássio Botaro.

This project covers the following concepts:

Python environments with Pipenv
Test Driven Development with PyTest
Starting with Flask framework
Continuous Integration with Travis
Continuous Deployment with Heroku
Starting from what has been taught, I improved the API with MongoDB persistence.

                #Rock Paper Scissors

The code starts by printing a message that states the rules of the game.
The first line in the code prints “Rock vs paper->paper wins.”
This is because if you have a rock, and you play against someone who has a piece of paper, the rock will beat the paper.
The next line in the code prints “Rock vs scissor->Rock wins.”
This is because if you have a rock, and you play against someone who has a scissors, the rock will beat the scissors.
The last line in the code prints “paper vs scissor->scissor wins.”

This is because if you have a piece of paper, and you play against someone who has a scissors, then the piece of paper will beat the scissors.
The code will print the following output: Winning Rules of the Rock paper scissor game as follows: Rock vs paper->paper wins Rock vs scissor->Rock wins paper vs scissor->scissor wins
The code starts by asking the user for a choice.
The code then checks to see if the input is 1, 2, or 3.
If it is not one of those values, the code sets the choice_name variable to ‘Rock’ if choice == 1, ‘paper’ if choice == 2, and ‘scissor’ if choice == 3.
The next part of the code asks the user for their computer turn.
The code uses a random number generator to choose between 1, 2, and 3.
This value is stored in comp_choice_name.

Next, the code loops until comp_choice equals choice.
In each loop iteration, comp_choice will be randomly chosen from 1-3 and stored in comp_choice_name.
Once comp_choice equals choice, this means that the computer has chosen rock as its turn!
Finally, it prints out both choices so that everyone can see what happened (user choice is: Rock V/s paper; Computer choice is: Rock V/s scissor).
The code will ask the user for a choice between rock, paper and scissors.
Once the user enters their choice, the code will randomly choose one of those options as the computer’s turn.
The code then prints out the chosen option and the user’s choice.
Finally, it loops back to ask for another choice from the user.  


                #Contact Book

 Contact book is a GUI-based project built using Python Tkinter module and message module. A contact book is used to store some person’s contacts like name, phone number etc. In this project, we’ll build our own contact book using the python programming language.
